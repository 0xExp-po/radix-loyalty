# TODO
## Main
[x] Mint Membership NFT 
[||] view NFT metadata on dashboard - NFT IDs are wrong on dashboard (could be bug on their side). Rest can be read.

[x] Invoke task with "reward_amount" and "reason" as inputs, requiring member proof

[] logging: how do I log the reason for the reward and persist that on blockchain transaction

[] Make membercard none transferable (soul bound)

## Enhancements needed for Demo insha-Allah
[] Make sure ISACA tokens have updatable burnable option via admin
[] Image URLs for ISACA tokens (see Gumball example)
[] Image URLs for EARTH tokens (Petrichor Reward tokens)

[] add admin to ISACA
